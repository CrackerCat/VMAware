> [!IMPORTANT]
> The main branch is much more updated with features that haven't been added yet to the latest release. However, they are experimental. 
> If you want something more stable, it's highly recommended to use the ones in the release section instead.

> On the other hand, testing the main branch version is advised so that feedback can be given back to make the library better.
